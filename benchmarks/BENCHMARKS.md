The code we used to benchmark the results is available at: https://github.com/KIT-ISAS/web-app
The same folder as this readme also includes the raw results we got from running the benchmarks.

Please refer to the top of the `benchmark_fib_starts.py` file in the KIT-ISAS/web-app repo for instructions on how to run the benchmarks yourself.
